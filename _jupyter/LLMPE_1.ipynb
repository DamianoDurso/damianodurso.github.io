    "# The Modern Workhorse for People Analytics: Leveraging Language Models for Better Surveys\n",
    "\n",
    "**How often do you rely on surveys to measure employee engagement, customer satisfaction, or candidate fit?** In people analytics, these tools are indispensable. They help organizations gather insights and make informed decisions. However, building reliable surveys is complex and resource-intensive. Many fall back on poor measures due to the high cost, risk, and time involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog series will explore how **Large Language Model Embedding Psychometrics (LLMEP)** can streamline survey creation and make it easier, cheaper, and more effective. We’ll also delve into its coding so you can try it yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first post, I’ll cover how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can help transform survey questions into data for people analytics, enhancing accuracy and depth without requiring traditional data collection. Let’s dive in and discover how this applies to people analytics!"

    "## Challenges in Traditional Survey Development\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to creating surveys for people analytics, there are several hurdles that organizations often encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Costly & Time-Consuming**: Crafting valid questions involves a considerable investment of resources. It requires in-depth research, rigorous testing, and a substantial dataset for validation. This process can be both financially burdensome and time-consuming.\n",
    "- **High Failure Risk:** Even slight changes in the phrasing of questions can have a significant impact on the validity of responses. Additionally, administering multiple variations of surveys can lead to respondent fatigue and introduce bias into the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these challenges, the question arises: **Can we streamline this process without compromising the quality of the data gathered?** This is where LLMEP steps in. By addressing these challenges and providing a more efficient and effective approach to survey development, LLMEP offers a solution that not only simplifies the process but also allows to test the quality and validity of the questions before collecting any data.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Large Language Models** such as GPT and BERT have transformed natural language processing. But how can they benefit people analytics? These models convert text into numerical representations known as *embeddings*, which capture sentence (or questions) meaning and can be further used to analyze survey data.\n",

    "For people analytics, LLMs can:\n",

    "Imagine that you are developing a survey to measure workplace recognition, which you define as *\"Workplace recognition is the acknowledgment and appreciation of an individual or a team's efforts, achievements, and contributions within the work environment. It can take the form of praise, rewards, or other forms of positive reinforcement to motivate and encourage employees.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that, after some careful consideration, **you have managed to create a list of 10 questions** that you think are suitable to measure workplace recognition. However, this list is still too long, and different **stakeholders tell you that you can only use three questions because they don't want to overburden employees**. Also, you probably fear that by using too many questions the employees' motivaton to respond would drop, resulting in careless responding or other response biases, which would ultimately leave you with useless results.\n",

That is, rather than focusing on the existence of recognition structures, SBERT picks a question that is more likely to evoke feelings of appreciation and personal acknowledgment, **which seems to be supported by some [recent research](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-05872-010)**. In any case, this is just a toy example, so you could probably find compelling arguments as well for having recognition systems in place."
